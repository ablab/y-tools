## Usage
For more information about how to use this project in your own programs, please check out the
[wiki](https://github.com/RedFantom/ttk-themes/wiki). You can also find example images of all
themes there, so you can choose one easily.
  
## Recommendations
The themes `plastik`, `clearlooks` and `elegance` are recommended to make your UI look nicer
on all platforms when using `Tkinter` and the `ttk` extensions in Python. When you are targeting
Ubuntu, consider using the great `radiance` theme.
