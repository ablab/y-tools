======== IgDataCleaner starts


==== Conversion from FASTQ to FASTA
6 reads were rewritten from /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/merged_reads.fastq to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/merged_reads.fasta
* FASTA file with merged reads was written to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/merged_reads.fasta

==== Running IgBLAST
* Output of IgBLAST alignment was written to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/cleaned/igblast.align

==== Searching for contaminated reads
3 read(s) will be filtered

=== Searching for short reads
0 read(s) will be filtered

==== Writing cleaned and filtered reads
6 alignment block(s) were read from /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/cleaned/igblast.align
6 reads were processed
IgBlast output was parsed
* 3 cleaned reads were written to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/cleaned/cleaned_reads.fastq
* 3 filtered reads were written to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/cleaned/filtered_reads.fastq

==== Correction of IgBLAST alignment output for cleaned reads
* IgBLAST align output for cleaned reads was written to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/cleaned/igblast_cleaned.align

======== IgDataCleaner ends

Main output files:
* Cleaned merged reads were written to /Johnny/starostina/roche_release/algorithmic-biology/assembler/ig_test_dataset/cleaned/cleaned_reads.fastq
